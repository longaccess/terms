Acceptable Use Policy

Last Modified: January 13, 2014

We are proud of the trust placed in us. In exchange, we trust you to
use our services responsibly.

Long Access services are intended and designed to be used for digital
archive preservation.

Typical use cases may include but are not limited to preserving
family photos and videos, or professional documents. In most cases,
users are expected to share Archive Certificates with a limited
number of interested parties, such as their family members, or
business associates, which may result in a limited number of archive
downloads over a given time period. We do not want to set hard
limits, but you can be sure that sharing an Archive Certificate with
10 people is inside the intended use limits. If you intend to share
Archive Certificates with a significantly larger number of people
(for example, all students attending your class), please let us now
before purchasing a Capsule.

Our service is not intended for public file sharing. We may
automatically limit access to a specific archive for a short period
of time, in cases of uncommonly large amounts of traffic.

You agree not to misuse the Long Access services.

For example, you must not, and must not attempt to, use the services
to do the following things.

- Share your Archive Certificates too many times; we may
automatically limit your downloads for a short period of time, in
cases of uncommonly large amounts of traffic. Our service is not
intended for public file sharing.
- probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;
- breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication
measures;

by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing
any part of the Services;
- plant malware or otherwise use the Services to distribute malware;
- access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly
supported interfaces (for example, “scraping”);
- send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or
spam;

including “spoofing” or “phishing”;

another's rights;

hatred;
