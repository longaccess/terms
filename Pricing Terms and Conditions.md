Paid Capsules

Long Access offers you the option of buying one or more storage spaces, called “Capsules” in predefined sizes, for thirty (30) years for a flat fee.

Long Access accepts credit cards and will automatically charge your credit card, depending upon each “Capsule” you select to purchase. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Long Access is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Long Access reserves the right to revoke access to your Long Access account and delete the contents of such Capsule(s) which the applicable fees have not been paid for. If you do not bring your Long Access balance current within five (5) days after Long Access provides you with notification that your account is in arrears, Long Access reserves the right to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your Files.

Billing

The fees for each Capsule will be billed once, on the date you purchase the specific capsule(s). All prices are inclusive of VAT at the prevailing rate. Long Access will bill your credit card upon your purchase of Capsule(s). You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary for reasons that include, differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax, and you authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.

Νο Refund following Upload

We charge you a flat fee for a Capsule where you can store your Archives for thirty years. Even if you decide to cancel your account, your capsule will continue to exist and be accessible for thirty years to any and all holders of any Archive Certificate or a copy thereof. You acquire your thirty year capsule the minute you sign up to Long Access and pay the corresponding fee. For this reason, we do not provide a refund should you decide to cancel your account following an upload of any archives to each Capsule. For the same reason, Long Access does not provide refunds or credits for any partial years use of your Capsule(s).

In the case that you have not uploaded anything to a Capsule you purchased for at least three (3) weeks since the purchase date thereof, we are happy to provide a refund.

Cancelling Your Account

Your Long Access account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your account any time you wish or we terminate it.

Long Access Premium Accounts are prepaid and are non-refundable. You may cancel your Long Access Account at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to cancel your Account you may do so via your "Account" page. Should you elect to cancel your Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the fees that you may have paid to Long Access.

By paying for the purchase of a Capsule and providing Long Access with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.

For further information regarding your Long Access Account, please see the Long Access Terms of Service.

Cancelling a Capsule

You may be able to cancel your Long Access account any time you wish; however, it is not possible to cancel a Capsule. You purchase a Capsule for thirty (30) years and that is exactly how long it will exist for, even if you no longer have an account with Long Access. Your archives will remain in the Capsule(s) you stored them and they will be accessible to anyone who holds an Archive Certificate or a copy thereof corresponding to such Capsule(s).

Free Capsules

Long Access allows you to get a 250MB sandbox Capsule for one (1) year free of charge. Long Access reserves the right to terminate Free Capsules at any time, with or without notice. The contents of a Sandbox Capsule are automatically deleted after 30 days.
